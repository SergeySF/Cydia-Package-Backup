Simple project that takes the status file from an iOS Device, parses through the installed package list, and creates a new install list with all of your packages (or something similar depending on how you configure this mildly expandable app.)

Written in Java so that you can literally run this program on the iPhone itself if you have Saurik's Java packages installed from Cydia.
